											<p>Drawing the Majestic and the Everyday at Major London Galleries
												HAND-DRAWN SCENARIOS & NARRATIVE - Since 2016, James Gosling - aka The Artist in the Gallery Hall - has been drawing persistently and prolifically at the National Gallery London. 
												
												"I get great inspiration drawing frequently at The National Gallery. I am excited by the activity around me and by the visitors watching me draw. The gallery is the perfect place for me to feel driven, where a pleasurable tension is created – the constant stream of visitors set against the drama of epic subjects and the gallery interiors, enhanced by a driving soundtrack – all these aspects contribute to a heightened, anxious excitement, something I use as a stimulus. Often, I achieve a state that is a kind of ‘jouissance’ as the French have it – a physical and intellectual pleasure or ecstasy. I use and enjoy the tension enveloping me to draw extremely quickly. Such frenetic activity is at odds with the stillness I might experience art-working in the studio."</p>
