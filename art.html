												<h3>James Gosling

											<p>Drawing the Majestic and the Everyday at Major London Galleries
												HAND-DRAWN SCENARIOS & NARRATIVE - Since 2016, James Gosling - aka The Artist in the Gallery Hall - has been drawing persistently and prolifically at the National Gallery London. 
												
												"I get great inspiration drawing frequently at The National Gallery. I am excited by the activity around me and by the visitors watching me draw. The gallery is the perfect place for me to feel driven, where a pleasurable tension is created – the constant stream of visitors set against the drama of epic subjects and the gallery interiors, enhanced by a driving soundtrack – all these aspects contribute to a heightened, anxious excitement, something I use as a stimulus. Often, I achieve a state that is a kind of ‘jouissance’ as the French have it – a physical and intellectual pleasure or ecstasy. I use and enjoy the tension enveloping me to draw extremely quickly. Such frenetic activity is at odds with the stillness I might experience art-working in the studio."</p>

												<h3>Anna Vercambre

											</header>
											<p> 

												Documentary photographer
												
												Anna channels her lens towards the intersection of female reproductive health and the quiet acts of resistance and resilience that bind humanity. With a keen eye for detail and a deep empathy for her subjects, Anna aims to navigate the complexities of these intimate narratives with sensitivity. Her work transcends mere observation, delving into the intricate layers of human experience to unearth stories of courage, defiance, and hope. Through her photography, she sheds light on the often overlooked moments of struggle and triumph, amplifying the voices of those whose stories deserve to be heard. Anna's portfolio serves as a testament to the power of visual storytelling to provoke thought, inspire empathy, and encourage change. </p>
