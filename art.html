												<h3>Petra Backovska</h3>
											</header>
											<p>I started developing my art in 2016 in Brixton, relocating to Herne Hill in early 2020. 
												My creative journey started in my childhood when I discovered photography and maker movement. 
												Following my relocation to the UK I started developing my own art,  
												In 2017 I designed the infamous doorstops that became the number one product of PetraStation. 
												Since my creations are mostly popular in the USA I decided to reach out to my local neighborhood 
												and started attending Herne Hill Market on Sundays where I met with a great success since 2021. 
												In 2023-2024 I am undergoing restructure of my workshop. 
												I am aiming to use more sustainable materials and approach my art from a deeper level, 
												that is why I paused my Etsy shop so I have more time for artistic development.
												As much as I enjoy making a lot of items I discovered I enjoy custom orders too. 
												If you like my skills in multi-media creating that involves a combination of woodwork, 
												bio-plastics, cnc, electornics and modelling, please get in touch! 
												My Etsy is on holidays until summer 2024, but Gumroad shop is there for you to choose from 
												ready-to-go art I enjoyed making.</p>

												<h3>James Gosling

											<p>Drawing the Majestic and the Everyday at Major London Galleries
												HAND-DRAWN SCENARIOS & NARRATIVE - Since 2016, James Gosling - aka The Artist in the Gallery Hall - has been drawing persistently and prolifically at the National Gallery London. 
												
												"I get great inspiration drawing frequently at The National Gallery. I am excited by the activity around me and by the visitors watching me draw. The gallery is the perfect place for me to feel driven, where a pleasurable tension is created – the constant stream of visitors set against the drama of epic subjects and the gallery interiors, enhanced by a driving soundtrack – all these aspects contribute to a heightened, anxious excitement, something I use as a stimulus. Often, I achieve a state that is a kind of ‘jouissance’ as the French have it – a physical and intellectual pleasure or ecstasy. I use and enjoy the tension enveloping me to draw extremely quickly. Such frenetic activity is at odds with the stillness I might experience art-working in the studio."</p>

												<h3>Anna Vercambre 
													
													</h3>
											</header>
											<p> 

												Documentary photographer
												
												Anna channels her lens towards the intersection of female reproductive health and the quiet acts of resistance and resilience that bind humanity. With a keen eye for detail and a deep empathy for her subjects, Anna aims to navigate the complexities of these intimate narratives with sensitivity. Her work transcends mere observation, delving into the intricate layers of human experience to unearth stories of courage, defiance, and hope. Through her photography, she sheds light on the often overlooked moments of struggle and triumph, amplifying the voices of those whose stories deserve to be heard. Anna's portfolio serves as a testament to the power of visual storytelling to provoke thought, inspire empathy, and encourage change. </p>
