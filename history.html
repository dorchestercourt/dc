									<p>Morrell's, builders
										Cyril and Stanley Morrell were born in Harpenden Road,
										Streatham in 1908. Their father, Herbert Charles Morrell
										(1876-1921). Originally a carpenter, he had enlisted in
										the Royal Engineers in December 1897 under a “Short
										Service” agreement (up to 12 years) On his marriage
										certificate, dated 16 March 1907, he was described as a
										“builder”, and he gave his address as 23 Gipsy Hill, West
										Norwood.
										Herbert Charles Morrell expanded his business into
										Herne Hill, and in 1915-16 build two pairs of semi-de-
										tached houses at Nos 200-202 Herne Hill. Around
										1930, his two sons Cyril and Stanley set up their business,
										they were 22 at the time. They were later joined by their
										younger brother, Frank. At first the trio operated as C &
										H Morrell from Herne Hill but in 1932 they changed the
										firm's name to Morrell (Builders) Ltd and the next year set
										up an HQ in Bromley High Street Although young, the
										brothers were very entrepreneurial and could see the de-
										mand for housing in the outer London suburbs. Between
										1932 and 1935 Morrell (Builders) Ltd purchased large
										areas of farmland in Petts Wood, Coney Hall, West Wick-
										ham and Chelsfield, along with several sites in Bromley,
										Shortlands, Southborough, Hayes, and Orpington.
										In 1935 the brothers floated the company on the Stock
										Exchange. The plan was to raise £150,000 of new mon-
										ey to build shops on their estates, the rents providing
										funds to finance further building. However, the flotation
										was a flop and before long Morrell (Builders) was in se-
										vere financial difficulties - exacerbated by the infamous
										'mortgage strike' by purchasers of some of their houses
										in Coney Hall. The houses had many constructional faults
										and one couple, Elsy & Jim Borders, began withholding
										their mortgage repayments. The building society, The
										Bradford, sought to repossess the house but the Borders
										replied with a counterclaim for £500 to cover the cost
										of repairs they said they had had to carry out. The claim
										went to court and was followed by considerable adverse
										publicity for Morrell's. In the end the Borders had to pay
										up but the builder went bankrupt.</p>
